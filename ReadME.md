## Semester Project

Repo for the project of the class *Software Engineering for Data Science*

---

Ideas:

1. **AI Tactic**\
**Goal:** Propose tactics for soccer teams\
**Achievability:** Not achievable in 13 weeks\
**Source of data:** Videos from broadcasted games\
**Main computation:** Processing the data\
**Features of the project:** In a first moment, show to soccer aficionados a cool tool that gives automatic tactics for previous games, so that they can discuss with friends. Later, it could be a system that helps real soccer teams to be more eficiente.


2. **AI Academic Assistant**\
**Goal:** Python package that plugs-in someone's website repo and keep track of their research on Scholar, summarizes it and update the website\
**Achievability:** Probably achievable\
**Source of data:** Google Scholar, maybe arXiv\
**Main computation:** Not intensive\
**Features of the project:** A package that could be installed in the server that hosts the person's website

3. **AI Codebase Assistant**\
**Goal:** Create a browser plugin that can help you navigate through other people's code through natural language queries\
**Achievability:** Probably achievable\
**Source of data:** Maybe GitHub open-source codebases\
**Main computation:** Not intensive\
**Features of the project:** A browser plugin with an interactive UI so that the user can ask questions and retrieve information from the codebase, without having to dive into it
